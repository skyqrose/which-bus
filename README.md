# Which Bus?

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/skyqrose/which-bus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/skyqrose/which-bus)

MBTA transit predictions for a customizable list of stops.

Intended to help you decide which route to take when you have multiple options available. For example, to help you answer the question: "Should I take the Red Line or Commuter Rail from South Station to Braintree? Commuter Rail is faster, but is there a train soon?" You could make a list that shows predictions for the Red Line, Kingston/Plymouth Line, and Middleborough/Lakeville.

The list of selections is saved as query parameters in the url, so you can bookmark useful lists.

## Technical Details

To run:
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

Built on top of the [MBTA Streaming API](https://www.mbta.com/developers/v3-api/streaming)

Written in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/), my favorite language, with wonderful features like a compiler that totally eliminates runtime errors. It's a delight to write in, and I'd recommend trying it.

Hosted with GitHub Pages. There is no backend code for this project.

Disclaimer: I work for the MBTA doing stuff very similar to this, but this is a personal side project done on my own time.
